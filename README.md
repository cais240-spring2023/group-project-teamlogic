# TicTacToe App

This is a JavaFX application generated using the javafx-archetype-fxml Maven archetype. 
The command that was used to generate the project:

```bash
 mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.openjfx -DarchetypeArtifactId=javafx-archetype-fxml \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.0.6 -DgroupId=edu.wsu -DartifactId=tictactoe2023 -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
 -Djavafx-version=19.0.2 -Djavafx-maven-plugin-version=0.0.8 -DinteractiveMode=false
```
The following changes were done after the project was generated:
 - The model, controller, and view packages were created
 - The controller classes (generated by the archetype) were moved into the controller package
 - An example model interface and implementation class were added, along with a unit test
